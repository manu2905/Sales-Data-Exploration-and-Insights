# Sales-Data-Exploration-and-Insights

## Overview

The "Business Data Analysis and Visualization Project" is a comprehensive tutorial and hands-on demonstration that showcases practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python, specifically leveraging the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The project focuses on exploring and gaining insights from sales data, making it an ideal representation of real-world data science tasks.


**A. Key Questions Explored**

The project addresses the following high-level business questions:

Q1. What was the best month for sales, and how much was earned that month?

Q2. Which city sold the most products?

Q3. What is the optimal time to display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?

Q4. What products are most often sold together?

Q5. Which product sold the most, and why do you think it sold the most?



**B. Data Sources**

The project utilizes a dataset containing sales data, likely obtained from various sources. The data includes information such as order IDs, products, quantities sold, prices, and timestamps. Multiple CSV files are concatenated to create a consolidated DataFrame for analysis.


**C. Project Tasks**

1. Data Cleaning

2. Dropping NaN values from the DataFrame.

3. Removing rows based on specified conditions.

4. Changing column types using methods such as to_numeric, to_datetime, and astype.
   


**D. Data Exploration**

1. Analyzing sales trends over different months.

2. Determining the city that achieved the highest sales.

3. Identifying the optimal time for displaying advertisements based on purchase likelihood.

4. Discovering patterns of products frequently sold together.

5. Analyzing the product that sold the most and investigating reasons behind its success.
   

**E. Tools and Libraries Used**

1. Python: Programming language used for data analysis.

2. Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.

3. Matplotlib: Data visualization library.



**F. Conclusion**

The project not only provides a step-by-step guide to data cleaning and exploration but also delivers insights into real-world business questions. The analysis demonstrates proficiency in utilizing Python tools for data science tasks, making it an excellent addition to a data analyst's portfolio.
